# Project Presentation
---
+ Iâ€™m excited to present our ETL Pipeline for a Banking System. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building an efficient ETL pipeline, from data extraction through to reporting. Our goal is to show how we utilized tools like SSIS, SSAS, and Power BI to transform raw banking data into valuable, actionable insights.

+ In this presentation, I'll walk you through the steps, tools, planning, and execution that made this pipeline possible, and show how each tool plays a crucial role in delivering meaningful data insights for banking professionals.
